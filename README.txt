run_analysis.R transforms the original data sets into clean and tidy dataset by performing the following tasks:
* Reading the data
* Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set
* Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
* Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names
* From the data set in step 4, creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
